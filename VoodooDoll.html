                <p>Interacting with the voodoo doll will cause one of the 10 pins stuck in the doll to be pushed into it at random. This will cause the ghost to perform an interaction, and will drop the user's sanity by 5%. These forced interactions can include evidence sources past EMF Level 5, such as making the ghost interact with Ghost Writing Books, create silhouettes in D.O.T.S. Projectors, and touch doors, windows, and light switches for Fingerprints.</p>

            <div>
                <p>If the heart pin is pressed down, the user sanity will drop by 10%, and a cursed hunt will initiate in their immediate vicinity. Additionally, if the user's sanity is less than the sanity that the pressed pin would drain, all remaining pins will get pushed in and a cursed hunt will occur.</p>
