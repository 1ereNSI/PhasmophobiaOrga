                <p>The Ouija Board can be activated by left clicking on it, or toggling it directly if holding the board. Once activated, the planchette will appear. This will also cancel the setup phase if it is ongoing. The Ouija Board will then respond to voice input within 3 metres of it, either while holding the push-to-talk key, or asked directly if the player has the push-to-talk option turned off or is using a VR headset. The player asking the question must be within the investigation area to ask questions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>To deactivate the Ouija Board, any nearby player must say "Goodbye", which will make the planchette disappear. If the player who activated the board walks away from an active Ouija Board, or the player currently asking a question has insufficient sanity to "pay" for the question, the board will "burn" and break itself up, activating a cursed hunt.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Whether the ghost is "shy" or not does not affect its ability to respond via the Ouija Board. If the Ouija Board is asked a question but nothing happens, then either the board is not on or the phrase was not recognised. In some cases, faulty voice recognition is caused by losing focus of the game (whether by Alt-Tabbing or otherwise), and can be fixed by pressing the Windows key twice to refocus the game.</p>
