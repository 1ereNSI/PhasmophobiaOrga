                <p>The mirror must be toggled while inside the investigation area. When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the ghost room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and equipment or players present in the room will be visible. The only exception is if the player using the mirror is within its view; neither the player nor the mirror will be visible.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Using the haunted mirror will rapidly drain the sanity of the player at a rate of about 7.5%/s, including the animation of raising and lowering the mirror. If the user's sanity reaches zero, the mirror will break, and the ghost will start a cursed hunt from its current position. When the mirror breaks, the front of the mirror will become smashed, and a cracking noise will be emitted.</p>
